## Vulnerability

- A weakness in an asset that can be exploited
- Common reasons of include hardware/software misconfigurations, insecure design, inherent technology weaknesses (E.g.
  HTTP, FTP) and end users’ carelessness.

## Vulnerability Research

- Analysis of services, and configurations to discover vulnerabilities in a system.
- Classified based on security level (low, mid, high) and exploit range (local, remote)
- Purpose is to gather information on security trends, discover weaknesses to prevent attacks, and to know how recover
  from one.
- Tools include databases like [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org), [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org)
  and [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/)

## Vulnerability Assessment

- In-depth examination of the ability of a system to withstand the exploitation.
- Purpose is to identify weaknesses and predict the effectiveness of security measures in protecting resources from
  attacks.
- Gathers information on network vulnerabilities, application and services’ vulnerabilities and configuration errors.
- Types include:
  1. **Active Assessment** – Network scanning (hosts, services, vulnerabilities)
  2. **Passive Assessment** – Network sniffing (discover active systems)
  3. **Host-based Assessment** – Configuration-level check (directories, file systems)
  - More in the slides.
- Tools include OpenVAS and Nikto

## Vulnerability Management Life Cycle

![vulnerability management lifecycle](lifecycle.png)

1. Pre-Assessment:
   - Define scope, identify and prioritise assets (business processes, network architecture, etc.)
2. Vulnerability Assessment:
   - Run vulnerability scans, classify vulnerabilities, and assess the risk.
3. Post-Assessment:
   - Risk assessment (categorisation), remediation (patches), verification (rescan and check for fix), and monitoring (
    periodic scans, implement procedures like IDS/IPS)

## Common Vulnerability Types
- **Misconfigurations**: Most common vulnerability; caused by human error. E.g. open ports
- **Legacy Platforms**: Obsolete code; unsupported for patches.
- **System Sprawl**: Increased number of system/server connections without proper documentations/maintenance. 

## Vulnerability Assessment Reports
- Discloses risks detected, alerting organisation of possible attacks and countermeasures to fix security flaws
