## Basic Static Analysis

### PeID

- Packer detection (goofy ahh string = packed)
- Contains a plugin to unpack UPX

### PE View

- Metadata of the binary
- Points of interest:
  - `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS > IMAGE_FILE_HEADER` â€“ Contains the binary's compile time

### Dependency Walker

- Lists all the functions called by a binary
- A binary containing only 1 or 2 exports suggests that it is packed
  - No normal binary is able to operate with 1-2 exported functions
- Take note of file I/O and network related functions

### Strings

- Reveals hardcoded values of the binary
- File paths, web endpoints and other juicy info can be found here

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

- Can view in-memory strings, handles and loaded DLLs

### Process Monitor (Procmon)

- Filter allow you to see app-specific events
- Keep a lookout for file I/O and registry edits
